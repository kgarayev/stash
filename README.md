Stash is the brainchild of Kanan Garayev, developed independently during personal time. As the sole developer, Kanan implemented the frontend and backend functionalities, collaborated with a UX designer for UI design, and created the logo. 

## :art: Styling

Stash boasts a visually appealing design crafted with attention to detail. The CSS styling is entirely developed from scratch by Kanan, with some exceptions when utilising Material-UI components for specific cases. The app's responsive design ensures seamless user experiences across all devices.
